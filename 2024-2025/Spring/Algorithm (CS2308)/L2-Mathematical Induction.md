## Base Principle:
1. P(n) is true (n=1).
2. For each n, n>1, P(n-1) is true -> P(n) is true
3. Conculution: For all n âˆˆ N, P(n) is true.

## Strong Inducion:
1. P(n) is true when n=1.
2. For each n, n>1, for every k<n P(k) is true -> P(n) is true.
3. Conclusion: ...

## Another Form of Induction:
1. P(n) is true when n=1,2
2. For every n>2, P(n-2)->P(n)
3. Conclusion: ...

## Another Form of Induction II:
1. P(1)
2. For n>1 AND n=2^k (k)
